As a follow up to my prior [post](https://arefmalek.github.io/blog/revamp/2021/05/15/personal-site.html) on a revamped website, I [did it](https://arefmalek.github.io/)! I'm not going to lie, I'm sure there are tons of optimizations to make, but I'm really glad I did it - I had a feeling that learning ***any Javascript Framework*** would be of value, so I'm glad I finally picked up on it. 

With that being said, it was tons of fun, and I can really see the merit in taking a component-based approach to a website - instead of constantly stressing over how certain elements will add in the flow / design of a site, it is really refreshing just to have the site work in pure sections, and we get to pick and choose which components go where. It was really exciting to me, and again I am very glad I got to explore the framework. 

As far as what comes next, I'm thinking about trying out a web app, something trading oriented that hopefully will utilize a database. I realize those are all different things that will require their own time, but I've been eyeing any sort of break-in into the web-app game and I think this might be it. To be honest, I really wanted to do it due to quite literally every winning hackathon project being some GCP-backed webapp - I know I'll have to get some experience with that project setup to get some more skin in the game. 

All in all, I've had a bunch of fun writing up the new site, and I'm sure that this next project will also be a blast, let's see how it turns out :)
