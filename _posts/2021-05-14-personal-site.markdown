NOTE: I consider myself a beginner to the webdev scene (I have like all of 300-400
lines of HTML / CSS code of experience) so I don't really intend to write this
with any sort of bravado, just a way to put out my thoughts (and also as
a reminder to actually do the work of rewriting the website).

I tell the story fairly often about how I wrote my [portfolio](https://arefmalek.github.io/portfolio/) site without
Javascript (mainly because I didn't bother to try picking it up at the time)
pretty often but as I begin to explore some of the more structured web delivery
methods, I am really considering switching things up. 

Namely, I really like the idea of what you can do with ruby / jekyll (it's the
blogging engine that runs this site), where you just either set up the
premade system - setting up this blog was really just a lil bit of command line work - 
or just write something similar yourself. I like the idea that having a list
projects should have minimal boilerplate code, since the format should be
relatively similar between each of them. 

I'll say that for a portfolio or something that just should just "pop",
I truthfully think that an HTML / CSS presentation is enough. It's just as
I begin to try and incorporate the same theme to different aspects of my
website does the appeal of a more centralized system come to play.

Right now I'm eyeing something like a Flask app, or just any system that will
make it easy to have a consistent header, footer, and presentation cross-site
without having a bunch of repetitive code.

Really the remedy is just to start, and as I mentioned in the beginning,
I really just wanted something out there to help plant the idea in my head of
a new type of website. We'll see how this whole thing pans out :).
