I've been really into Computer Vision for a while (especially on the Deep
Learning side), but I've began to realize I never really did explored the
fundamental image-processing side of CV. I've been peeping the [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)
project done at Google, and I knew I wanted to make something with it. 

What did I end up making? [Airdraw](https://github.com/arefmalek/airdraw)!. 
I'd be lying if I said it was the most expansive CV project conceived, but it's
been a ton of fun to work on, especially as I got to bring together math I've
learned in class with the CS stuff I love to do. I'll start to write about the
big chunks of the project below.

## Overall layout
This was more of a GUI thing with OpenCV, I just tried to find some basic code
on how to set up rectangles and whatnot. This started out pretty well, but
I definitely had to go with an immediate limitations as to how many options for
colors / other operations I would support. 

Right now, I'm sticking with three colors (R,G,B - fitting for a CV project
after all) and a clear output function so that someone can always have a clean
canvas.

## How do we draw?
The point of Airdraw was to have a canvas on demand, and with MediaPipe making
it so easy to get the metadata from my hand, I just needed to come up with some
convention of alignment between my fingers to signify I'm in 'drawing' mode vs.
not. I ended up going with the convention of index finger up meaning draw, two
fingers up indicating I'm 'pausing' the drawing (basically I'm not in drawing
mode). 

I had waypoints along my hand, so what I ended up doing here to make it
work is that I am making one vector along my index finger, and another vector
along my middle finger. With two separate vectors, I could measure how
'colinear' they were by using the dot product of the two vectors. I won't dive
into multivariable calculus / linear algebra here, but the [dot product](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/thinking-about-multivariable-function/x786f2022:vectors-and-matrices/a/dot-products-mvc) 
of two vectors essentially shows you how 'similar' two lines are. With some
simple algebra, I can get the angle between my index and middle finger. All
I wrote the code to do was to check if my index and middle finger have a dot
product that is near 1 - which would indicate drawing - and if not that means
my fingers are close together. It's probably best shown with an example.

Notice what the dot product is negative and the orientation of my hands when it
is so.

## Converting fingerpoints to lines
This was one of the larger problems of the project, and something that I did
have to start breaking out more classes for. I essentially treated the frame as
a canvas, and the way I would start to convert my finger data onto lines and
the color associated with them. I would then put all of this into queue and
start to traverse the queue to draw accordingly. 

This may seem like overkill to draw a few lines, but the important thing to
realize is that each of the lines, circles, or any continuous shape drawn is
it's own line, and in order to not have just one cursive line, we need to
separate what we're dealing with here.
