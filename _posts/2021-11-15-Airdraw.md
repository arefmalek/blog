I've been really into Computer Vision for a while (especially on the Deep
Learning side), but I've began to realize I never really did explored the
fundamental image-processing side of CV. After finding the the [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)
project done at Google, and I knew I wanted to make something with it. 

What did I end up making? [Airdraw](https://github.com/arefmalek/airdraw)!
I'd be lying if I said it was the most expansive CV project conceived, but it's
been a ton of fun to work on, especially as I got to bring together math I've
learned in class with the CS stuff I love to do. I'll start to write about the
big chunks of the project below.


## The Current Status:

## Drawing
What does drawing-only look like? Let me show you!

### Overall layout
This was one of the last things I really thought about, as the challenge was really
converting an image of someone's hand into a line being drawn. That being said,
a layout was essential to the project because otherwise people are just trapped
to a single color, and no functionality!

I ended up choosing a layout where we choose colors and have a hard reset
button. In keeping the project similar to an MS paint type, I just wanted
someone to quickly select the color one is looking for and get to drawing, and
can reset the canvas when they choose. 

In the future, this can scale really well because all we are doing to get the
colors is appending to a single list (none of this is really hardcoded), but
finding a UI to make this work will be another thing to try, as limiting
the colors takes away from the fun of the app.

Right now, Airdraw starts up with three colors (R,G,B - fitting for an image
manipulation project after all) and a clear output function so that someone 
can always have a clean canvas.

### What about our Hands?
The point of Airdraw was to have a canvas on demand, and with MediaPipe making
it so easy to get the metadata from my hand, I just needed to come up with some
convention of alignment between my fingers to signify I'm in 'drawing' mode vs.
not. I ended up going with the convention of index finger up meaning draw, two
fingers up indicating I'm 'pausing' the drawing (basically I'm not in drawing
mode - I called this "hover" mode). 

I had waypoints along my hand, so what I ended up doing here to make it
work is that I am making one vector along my index finger, and another vector
along my middle finger. With two separate vectors, I could measure how
'colinear' they were by using the dot product of the two vectors. I won't dive
into multivariable calculus / linear algebra here, but the 
[dot product](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/thinking-about-multivariable-function/x786f2022:vectors-and-matrices/a/dot-products-mvc) 
of two vectors essentially shows you how 'similar' two lines are. 

With some simple algebra, I can get the angle between my index and middle finger. All
I wrote the code to do was to check if my index and middle finger have a dot
product that is near 1 - which would indicate drawing - and if not that means
my fingers are close together. It's probably best shown with an example.

Notice how the dot product increases as my fingers come together, this
essentially is just the cosine of the angle between my fingers is approaching
1 (and therefore the angle between my two fingers approaches 0).

### Converting fingerpoints to lines
This is how we start to draw! Now that we have a way to determine the "mode" we
are in, as well as some tools to keep track of what we're drawing, all that's
left is to use a metric to actually draw. For this, I treated each line as
a LinkedList: there would be conditions to start a line (because we may have
been in hover mode before) and conditions to end a line (changing colors,
clearing screen, etc.). For those who don't know, a [linked
list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a data structure in
computer science that doesn't necessarily give order, but has each node in the
list point to the next one. This is all we need in our project, as the 'lines'
you see are really just smaller lines connected each of the points where our
hand previously was.

This may seem like overkill to explain how to draw a few lines, but it's
important to mention because each of the lines, circles, or any other shape is
it's own entity, and needs a class dedicated to it (at least in the easiest
implementation). 


## Eraser 
![Initial Demo now works with an eraser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arefmalek/airdraw/main/demo.gif)

This was the part I worked on over the last bit of winter break. With a list of
arbitrary poitns on an image (which is essentially a 2-D array), the trick to
have a 2-D array of the same size in the background, values would be pointers
to the points of the line being drawn. I made this work by using a hashmap to
store the lines because if we have that earlier 2-D array store the 'key' to
lines - the order of lines being drawn each frame doesn't really matter, as 
long as they are there!

The second small thing is that I had to include a little radius around the
finger, becauase aligning a single pixel is really an uphill battle. It may cause
a slowdown because a circle is O(n^2), but I'll figure that out when the
problem arises.
