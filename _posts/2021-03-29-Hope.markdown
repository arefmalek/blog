This is a whole jumble of thoughts but I really wanted to get this out as
a letter to me in the future. I know there are times that I will have my ups
and my downs, but the most important things are for me to keep hope. I was
reading through a letter I wrote to myself around half a year ago and I can't
believe that of the 5 things I couldn't imagine myself developing, I have
already ventured into 4 of them. I mention this because as future problems
arrive and show me new situations I have never been in before, I actually think
it's one of the biggest blessings I could ask for. Every day, I will have a new
opportunity to improve and make a bigger development than I did yesterday.

Right now, there are a couple of things left I really want to cross off the
bucket list and I came into new hope I didn't have before. What's important to
note is that I know realize that I am truly glad that I was really ambitious in the
past with what I wanted to achieve, and although I am at that new point,
I really wanted this written down to myself in the future, that I am being
super ambitious because I believe I can sleep better knowing that despite the
probability of failure, I can still expect myself to try.

"No matter what you been through, no matter what you into, I feel like I got to
tell you you got something to contribute". Believe in me <3
