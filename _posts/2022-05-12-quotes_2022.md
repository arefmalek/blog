Anyone that's been on FaceTime with me this past year knows I keep a wall of
quotes on the back of my dorm (they're the post-it notes in this [example](../assets/airdraw/eraser.gif)). 
Most are of the quotes are from rappers, some are from business leaderes
I admire, all of them serve the purpose of inspiring me whenever I look back at
my wall.

I made the stupid move of NOT keeping them with me when I was moving out of my
dorm, so I'm writing up some of the ones I can remember, and will
probably just write up new quotes here from now on.

With all being said, enjoy!
