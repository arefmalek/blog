This will probably be a mess, but I finally got something up and running! I've
been meaning to write find some medium to express more of what I have on my
mind for a while now and although it's a may seem a little lame to settle on
a blog, I really am glad I got it done.

As far as future plans and whatnot goes, I've got my eyes on a couple of
projects right now and I'm hoping I'll find a way to land them soon. I also
have been eyeing a certain random goal (super specific I know right) that
I think I just might be able to mark off by the end of the next week.

If anybody but me reads this, honestly thanks for your time, but more seriously
this is one of those larger moments where a lot of knowledge I have had kind of
comes together to allow me to achieve something that feels small, but is
representative of a much larger journey. Thanks for tuning into the intro :^).
