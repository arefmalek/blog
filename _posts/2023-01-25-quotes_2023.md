"I have only made this letter longer because I have not had the time to make it
shorter" - Blaise Pascal

"One thing I learned about life is that you always get backpay eventually. Can't escape your karma, good or bad" - Nip Hussle

"Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise control over how
and what you think."
"This is the freedom of being well-adjusted, of learning how to be
'well-adjusted.' You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what
doesn't. You get to decide what to worship.... There is no such thing as
atheism, everybody worships. ... And the compelling reason for choosing god or
some spiritual-type thing to worship ... is that everything else will eat you
alive." - David Foster Wallace, [This is water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAd4HGJS4o)
