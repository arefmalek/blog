Yesterday my roommate and I were talking a lot about how programming languages
for the most part really dictate how you think programmatically. My roommate
brought up the point about how the first few programming languages probably did
not have too much thought put into them as far as their future impact, but
knowing the way programmers are, they basically laid the foreground for a large
chunk of algorithmic thought.

It got me wondering, how you can really influence the thought process by tools
you provide people. The tools that dominate how a plethora of people think (I'm
thinking social media, but there are myriads of others options) were designed
for certain objectives in mind. As I say this aloud, it's obvious that you
design languages for a *reason*, but I think the power of the linguistics of
these programming languages is that nobody really takes the time to study them,
but there architecture quite literally spawns a new wave of thinking - maybe it
be R for statisticians, or maybe JS for creative development. 

Accessibility is one thing, but I think the ability to quitely move the thought process of millions something that will definitely add up without us knowing. 
Think about how many people will use a technology whose inventor probably
learned it out of pure curiousity. It's important to specify that because
assume it was a different language, the tools available would probably lead
that inventor down a separate route of creation, likely making a much different
product. Programming languages, the languages of thinking, are things we
don't really consider - as we are the ones who are writing out thought process
down in code - but they kind of push us in a certain way of thinking that we
can't usually identify until they leave an impact.
