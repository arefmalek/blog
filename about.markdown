I first started this blog with the intention of making it a technical one, but
I now see this as a scratchpad for thoughts. I'll try to upload more often now,
even if the topics aren't CS related - I just may have a post on Neural
Networks followed by Evangelion Analysis (always down to talk about the show).

All love - Aref
