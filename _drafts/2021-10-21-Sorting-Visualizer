With school and a hunt for a job going on, it's been a struggle to find time
for projects, but I'm really glad I got to make
[this](https://arefmalek.github.io/Sorting_Visualizer/).
This project was definitely one of the bigger introductions to Javascript
(and more appropriately, my entry to the "I hate Javascript" club).
That being said there were three difficult parts of the project

## 1. Drawing random arrays
A central part of the experience is that you should be able to generate random
arrays on demand in order to see how any given array can be sorted by the
sorted algorithm of your choice. That means I had to figure out how to draw
a brand new array to the canvas on any given moment. I personally struggled
with dynamically drawing to the canvas until I set up the draw_array
function  - heavily inspired by `draw_array` function
[here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/sorting.js/js/sorting.js).
