I've been really into Computer Vision for a while (especially on the Deep
Learning side), but I've began to realize I never really did explored the
fundamental image-processing side of CV. I've been peeping the [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)
project done at Google, and I knew I wanted to make a project with it. 

What did I end up making? [Airdraw](https://github.com/arefmalek/airdraw)!. 
I'd be lying if I said it was the most expansive CV project conceived, but it's
been a ton of fun to work on, especially as I got to bring together math I've
learned in class with the CS stuff I love to do. I'll start to write about the
big chunks of the project below.


## Overall layout
This was more of a GUI thing with OpenCV, I just tried to find some basic code
on how to set up rectangles and whatnot

## How do we draw?
The point of Airdraw was to have a canvas on demand, and with MediaPipe making
it so easy to get the metadata from my hand, I just needed to come up with some
convention of alignment between my fingers to signify I'm in 'drawing' mode vs.
not. I ended up going with the convention of index finger up meaning draw, two
fingers up indicating I'm 'pausing' the drawing (basically I'm not in drawing
mode). 

I had waypoints along my hand, so what I ended up doing here to make it
work is that I am making one vector along my index finger, and another vector
along my middle finger. With two separate vectors, I could measure how
'colinear' they were by using the dot product of the two vectors. I won't dive
into multivariable calculus / linear algebra here, but the [dot product](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/thinking-about-multivariable-function/x786f2022:vectors-and-matrices/a/dot-products-mvc) 
of two vectors essentially shows you how 'similar' two lines are. With some
simple algebra, I can get the angle between my index and middle finger. All
I wrote the code to do was to check if my index and middle finger have a dot
product that is near 1 - which would indicate drawing - and if not that means
my fingers are close together. It's probably best shown with an example

![Demo of my fingers and dot product]( "Fingers together, then apart")

## Converting fingerpoints to lines
Currently I'm here - now I know that I'm drawing, how am I supposed to actually
draw? This will take some time fs.
