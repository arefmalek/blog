title: Airdraw with Spirals

This is just to leave a reminder that I think there is a positive application of Airdraw!

I ended up going back to my high school the day I came back from university and the first teacher I visited was my APCS teacher.
While explaining the project, I ended up talking with another student who is basically a bioinformatics specialist.
He spent the last summer on Parkinson's, and explained how he tried to use the same ML library I did - [Mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) - but on individual's eyes. 
He saw promise in using Airdraw to draw spirals, and that's probably the next application I plan on writing it for.
